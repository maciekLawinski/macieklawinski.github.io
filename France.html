  <h1> Restruants </h1>

    <!-- --- Restaurant 1 --- -->
    <h2> Le Gabriel (romantic ) </h2>
    <p>Within the gold and bronze setting of Le Gabriel, Jérôme Banctel has crafted a deeply personal cuisine – calmly creative, subtly technical, and always focused on the product, which is sourced from his native Brittany or French forests during game season. Here, there are no grandiose menu titles or overuse of luxury ingredients as a cover-up. Instead, he moves diners with a ‘simple’ dish of Bretagne carrot des sables, an artichoke (glazed with cherry vinegar), or squid (slow-cooked in duck fat). You won’t find a more evocative dinner for such a good price anywhere else in Paris. .</p>

    <h2>The Resto U-Crous (student)</h2>
    <p> If you have a student card your menus will only cost, you 3.25 euros.  Be My Nounou Team think that is impossible to find cheaper in Paris! For example: The restaurant U in Mabillon (6ème arrondissement) offers you a beautiful view of the roofs of Paris and a coffee at unbeatable prices. Cheap brunch for students in Paris: “Brunch” and “cheap”.</p>

    <h2> La Rotonde (Family) </h2>

    <h2> Chez Janou (Adventure) </h2>
    <p>If you’re craving that quintessential Parisian bistro vibe with a side of southern French flair, Chez Janou is your spot. Tucked away in the Marais, this place is always buzzing – think vintage décor, checkered floor tiles, and tables squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder. Their chocolate mousse is legendary (served from a giant bowl at your table), but don’t sleep on the classic ratatouille or the generously-loaded Niçoise salad. The pastis selection is wild; you’ll find bottles here you’ve never even heard of. Best tables are on the leafy terrace for people-watching. </p>

  <h1>Destination and vies of intresest</h1>

    <h2>Palais Garnier</h2>
    <p>Yes, the Garnier Palace is an architectural marvel, but the jewel: the performance hall with its superb Chagall ceiling is rarely visited. When there is not a show, it is the rehearsals that follow. And the majority of visitors come across closed doors. When you pick up your tickets you are never warned that the hall is closed. That day. And pay you full pot. It’s a shame because you feel like you’re being fooled like I heard a lot from tourist visitors. Of course, we were told that the room could be closed, but say so at the entrance when we take the tickets. Maybe we wouldn’t take them!</p>

      <div class="France-Destination_Eiffel">
       <h2>EIFFEL TOWER </h2>    
       <P>The Eiffel Tower captivates visitors with its majestic atmosphere and iconic views, especially enchanting at sunset or in the evening when its lights dazzle. Travelers find it easily accessible from central Paris, though long queues and complex navigation can hinder the experience. Booking tickets online in advance is strongly recommended to avoid extensive waits.</P>
