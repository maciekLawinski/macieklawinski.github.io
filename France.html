    <h2> Le Gabriel (romantic ) </h2>
    <p>Within the gold and bronze setting of Le Gabriel, Jérôme Banctel has crafted a deeply personal cuisine – calmly creative, subtly technical, and always focused on the product, which is sourced from his native Brittany or French forests during game season. Here, there are no grandiose menu titles or overuse of luxury ingredients as a cover-up. Instead, he moves diners with a ‘simple’ dish of Bretagne carrot des sables, an artichoke (glazed with cherry vinegar), or squid (slow-cooked in duck fat). You won’t find a more evocative dinner for such a good price anywhere else in Paris. .</p>

    <p>If you’re craving that quintessential Parisian bistro vibe with a side of southern French flair, Chez Janou is your spot. Tucked away in the Marais, this place is always buzzing – think vintage décor, checkered floor tiles, and tables squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder. Their chocolate mousse is legendary (served from a giant bowl at your table), but don’t sleep on the classic ratatouille or the generously-loaded Niçoise salad. The pastis selection is wild; you’ll find bottles here you’ve never even heard of. Best tables are on the leafy terrace for people-watching. </p>
