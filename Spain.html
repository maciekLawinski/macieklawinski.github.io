      <h3>Caminito del Rey (Adventure)</h3>
      <p>
        This almost 8-kilometre path was once known as one of the most dangerous in the world. Today it has been completely restored and is much safer, but one thing is still the same — the amazing feeling of walking along pathways hanging over 100 metres high on the side of a cliff. The views are truly unforgettable.
