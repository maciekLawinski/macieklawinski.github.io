<!-- ----------- RESTAURANTS SECTION ----------- -->

<h2>Quattroventi (adevnture restraunt) </h2>
<p>This restaurant distinguishes its classic environment, which makes it suitable for important meetings, and for gatherings of friends and families. It is also distinguished by the wonderful staff. The place offers a long carefully selected menu with many delicious options from modern Italian cuisine. Among the dishes it serves, you will find penne with basil, pasta in white sauce, grilled octopus with roses, meat pies, and many more.</p>

<h2>Trattoria Sabatino (student restraunt)</h2>
<p>This was a GOLDEN FIND!!! The restaurant doesn’t take reservations so my friends and I got there 20 minutes before opening to wait in line. This was probably the most authentic restaurant I visited while in Florence. It was completely family run, and every single menu item felt like something made specifically for me by a nonna (an Italian grandmother). I tried ravioli, roasted chicken, and four different kinds of desserts.</p>

<div class="Italy-sob">
<h1>Destinations and views of interest</h1>  
<img class="colosseum" src="folder/the colosseum.html">

<h2>THE COLOSSEUM</h2>  
<p>50,000 people on their feet, roaring with one voice, as gladiators below lock weapons and fight for fame, riches, and favor with the emperor. It’s easy to imagine this cinematic scene in the Colosseum. Although it’s been almost 2,000 years since ancient Romans used it for their mass entertainment, this stadium—now a UNESCO World Heritage site— still conveys epic grandeur, complete with those famous columned arcades. Inside, you’ll see a partially restored arena floor that acts as a platform above the “hypogeum”—the underground labyrinth of rooms and passageways that would have been the backstage area for the day’s entertainment. Look up, and you’ll spot tiered seating stretching up several levels. (V.I.P. seating is down low by the action; your average citizen was up high in the nosebleeds.) Certain tickets will let you access the underground up close and walk the arena floor in the footsteps of famed gladiators—no sword and shield required. </p>

<!--------------PANTHEON SECTION--------->
      <div class="Italy-Destinations_Pantheon">
        <img class="pantheon" src="folder/pantheon.html">
        <h2>PANTHEON</h2>
        <P>A triumph of ancient engineering. A resting place for kings and artists. A temple to the Gods. No wonder the Pantheon remains the beating heart of Rome’s historic center. Originally built around 27 BCE, this massive dome-topped monument was turned into a church in the seventh century and now draws millions of visitors each year. Before you step inside, take a (free) stroll around the outside of the Pantheon to see its curved exteriors. Then spring for a ticket to see the grand interiors. Its ornate geometry starts at the floor, basically a giant marble-and-granite checkerboard. Encircling that are columns and ornamental niches. And then there’s the showstopper: that domed ceiling with an opening at the top (the oculus), that lets in natural light and acts like a sundial throughout the day. It’s no wonder artists like Raphael asked to be buried here—it’s not a bad place to spend eternity.</P>

<!----------------TREVI FOUNTAIN SECTION------------->
          <div class="Italy-trevi">
            <img class="Italy-T" src="folder/Trevi fountain.html"> 
            <h2>Trevi Fountain</h2>
            <p>Rome has tons of epic fountains, but the Trevi Fountain is in a league of its own. Larger-than-life statues? Check. Cascades of water? You bet. A palace in the background? Absolutely. Top it all off with a seashell chariot driven by the god Oceanus, and you’ve got an aquatic wonderland that’s been drawing crowds since 1762. If you’ve visited the Trevi in the past, you may find things a little more complicated than it used to be. With tourism spiking in recent years (including Rome’s 2025 Jubilee year), the city has made some changes geared toward both preserving the fountain and making the experience better. You’ll still be able to see it just by walking through the Piazza di Trevi. But if you want to get close enough to throw in a coin, study the sculptures, or snap a pic, you’ll need to wait in line for a coveted “front row” spot.</p>
