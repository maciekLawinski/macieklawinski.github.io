<h2>Club del Doge Restaurant, Venice(romantic restraunt) </h2>

<h2>Quattroventi (adevnture restraunt) </h2>
This restaurant distinguishes its classic environment, which makes it suitable for important meetings, and for gatherings of friends and families. It is also distinguished by the wonderful staff. The place offers a long carefully selected menu with many delicious options from modern Italian cuisine. Among the dishes it serves, you will find penne with basil, pasta in white sauce, grilled octopus with roses, meat pies, and many more.

<h2>Trattoria Sabatino (student restraunt)</h2>
This was a GOLDEN FIND!!! The restaurant doesn’t take reservations so my friends and I got there 20 minutes before opening to wait in line. This was probably the most authentic restaurant I visited while in Florence. It was completely family run, and every single menu item felt like something made specifically for me by a nonna (an Italian grandmother). I tried ravioli, roasted chicken, and four different kinds of desserts.
